# Food ordering System
Through the study of COMP 202 (Data Structures and Algorithms) and gaining
crucial knowledge about different kinds of data structures like stacks , queues ,
linked lists BSTs and so on, we have undoubtedly increased our horizons in the
specter of programming. Having said that, writing a program using said data
structures was indeed a daunting task with various hurdles that we encountered along
the way.
The development of a food ordering system using C programming language, leveraging 
linked lists as the primary data structure.
It Explores libraries of C like conio.h, windows.h and time.h.
